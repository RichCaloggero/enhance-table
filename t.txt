The forum seems to be the main focus of the site in some ways, so it should be easy to use via screen reader.

The biggest issue in all forum software is navigating among posts, and knowing where you are in the hierarchy.

### Hierarchy

This forum seems to be fairly flat, so perhaps hierarchy isn't a huge issue at present. However, I could be missing something important which is visually apparent!

### Post navigation

Screen reader users cannot see the entire screen; they only see a single item, be it line, element, etc.  For instance, we can tab among focusable items (usually links, buttons, and form controls), and we can use screen reader shortcuts to move among headings, and another set of shortcuts to move among landmarks (i.e. `nav` elements, etc).

THus we suggest:

#### Each post be introduced via heading

For instance this topic:
http://lcl-discuss.media.mit.edu/t/unplugged-activities-for-teaching-technology-to-kids/221

- the only heading here is the `h1` which introduces the thread:
	+ h1: Unplugged Activities for Teaching Technology to Kids? 
- the first post begins as follows:

One area I’m super interested to hear how others are handling is how to best incorporate unplugged activities with teaching technology to kids. I’ve poked around the internet, and found a small

- suggest wrapping the heading around the name, date
	+ >```
	<h2>

	```
	+ doing this allows the screen reader user to quickly move among posts with one keystroke


## Replying

- remove `tabindex` from the reply button
	+ Please remove all `tabindex` attributes which have a positive value from the site!!!  This causes reading order problems for screen reader users and should _never_ be done!
- The reply button has `aria-label` on it whose value overrides any text which may be in the `button`.  Remove `aria-label` here, since it is also duplicated in `title`, which is presented in addition to the text in the button.
- hide icons with `aria-hidden` like this: `<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-reply d-icon d-icon-reply"></i>` 


```
<button tabindex="5" aria-label="Or press Ctrl+Enter" title="Or press Ctrl+Enter" id="ember1773" class="btn btn-icon-text btn-primary create ember-view">
  <i class="fa fa-reply d-icon d-icon-reply"></i>
  <span class="d-button-label">Reply<!----></span>
</button>
```
